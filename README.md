# load-geotiff-dev
Code created by Grace Llewellyn implementing a function load\_geotiffs that allows a user to pass in geotiff links and have wmts tiles printed to CMC

Currently this repo just contains 2 notebooks that document my attempts and outcomes when uploading a mosaic JSON to the Tiler in MAAP ops and Pilot ops
